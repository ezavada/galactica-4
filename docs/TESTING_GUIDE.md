# Testing Guide for Galactica-4

Last reviewed: 2026-08-25

## Running the suite

Run tests with the PDG runtime from the project root:

```bash
cd /Users/edz/Documents/Personal/galactica-4
./gad4 tests/run-tests.js
```

Current expected result:

```text
Total: 731
Passed: 731 ✓
Failed: 0 ✗
```

The output is intentionally verbose because several game systems still log turn, combat, movement, and construction diagnostics.

Use only the pinned PDG runtime (`./gad4`) for the full suite. The tests and runtime use PDG globals and APIs, including `pdg.res`, `pdg.srand()`, `pdg.rand()`, `pdg.Point`, and drawing attributes.

## Test runner

`tests/run-tests.js` loads these suites:

- `string-resources.test.js`
- `map-generation.test.js`
- `coordinate-movement.test.js`
- `player-config.test.js`
- `ai-systems.test.js`
- `zoom-scroll.test.js`
- `zoom-to-point-bug.test.js`
- `entity-fog-of-war.test.js`
- `visibility-calculator.test.js`
- `spatial-partition.test.js`
- `fog-of-war-integration.test.js`
- `spatial-partitioning-performance.test.js`
- `fleet.test.js`
- `combat.test.js`
- `game-rules.test.js`
- `command-ui.test.js`
- `fleet-formation.test.js`
- `rendezvous.test.js`
- `ship-naming-events.test.js`
- `attention.test.js`
- `event-reports.test.js`
- `scrapping.test.js`
- `visual-effects.test.js`
- `language-settings.test.js`
- `startup-setup.test.js`
- `autoplay.test.js`

## What the tests cover

- String resource loading for the default resource file, plus localized ID parity and placeholder compatibility across all supported language files.
- v3-style map generation, star naming, homeworld assignment, and seeded reproducibility.
- Coordinate conversion, camera zoom/pan, and ship movement.
- Player info, game configuration, ownership, and serialization helpers.
- AI manager/player utilities, decision plumbing, and ownership protection.
- Fog-of-war entity state, visibility calculations, spatial partitioning, and integration paths.
- Fleet creation, joining, merging, movement, and formation rules.
- Runtime combat resolution, v3-style ship/star strength formulas, destruction, interception, docked defenders, colony capture, defeat/victory updates, and combat summary events.
- V3 game-rule parity for technology transfer, neutral-colony defaults, captured-colony defaults, and AI-facing movement/patrol guards.
- Command UI state, windows, permanent map buttons, popup action buttons, production sliders, hover behavior, and layout details.
- Rendezvous creation/placement, fleet assembly at rendezvous points, named fleet/rendezvous UI, fleet roster rows, and fleet member remove/transfer controls.
- Ship naming and new tech/class event overlays.
- Deterministic AI-only autoplay setup, per-player AI skill assignment, 250-turn default cap, quiet/visible event-window modes, victory/stalemate state, and autoplay stop conditions.

## AI-only parity observer

Run the deterministic smallest-map AI observer with:

```bash
./gad4 -- --ai-autoplay
```

This starts five computer players and no human players. Players 1-5 represent the five v3 AI skill settings: Expert, Good, Average, Passable, and Novice. The default seed is `424242`, fog is disabled for observation, and the game advances automatically until the win condition or the 250-turn max-turn guard is reached.

Autoplay hides event presentation windows by default for unattended testing. Add `--show-event-windows` to display lab/stardock overlays; when shown, the overlays are held briefly before dismissal so they get a visible beat even when the turn timer is short.

Useful options:

```bash
./gad4 -- --ai-autoplay --seed=314159 --autoplay-delay=100 --autoplay-max-turns=250 --show-event-windows --autoplay-event-ms=1000
```

## Important interpretation

Passing tests mean the covered code paths behave as tested. They do not prove full v3 parity or complete runtime integration for every scaffolded system.

Examples:

- AI tests cover active AI turn participation, v3-backed economy/build rules, ship/fleet scoring, skill differences, patrol behavior, and advantage modifiers. Player-facing setup/debug UI remains separate.
- Fog-of-war tests cover current visibility recalculation, last-seen memory, scanner-based fleet visibility, and some rendering behavior. Full v3 remembered-object presentation is not complete.
- Combat tests cover the current v3-style runtime combat/capture path. Final combat presentation, richer fleet reports, and broader balance tuning remain work items.

Use `docs/V3_V4_FEATURE_STATUS.md` for parity status.

## Deterministic random numbers

Tests use PDG's RNG:

```javascript
pdg.srand(42);
pdg.rand();
```

Use `pdg.srand()` in any test that depends on random map generation, AI choices, or combat values. Avoid `Math.random()` unless nondeterminism is explicitly acceptable.

## Adding tests

1. Add a `*.test.js` file under `tests/`.
2. Export a function that registers tests with `tests/test-framework.js`.
3. Add the suite to `tests/run-tests.js`.
4. Seed PDG RNG when randomness is involved.
5. Keep assertions focused on observable behavior, not incidental debug output.

Available assertions include:

```javascript
test.assertEqual(actual, expected, message)
test.assertNotEqual(actual, expected, message)
test.assertApproximately(actual, expected, tolerance, message)
test.assertInRange(value, min, max, message)
test.assertTrue(value, message)
test.assertFalse(value, message)
test.assertNull(value, message)
test.assertNotNull(value, message)
test.assertDefined(value, message)
test.assertArrayLength(array, length, message)
test.assertContains(array, value, message)
test.assertGreaterThan(actual, expected, message)
test.assertLessThan(actual, expected, message)
test.assertThrows(fn, message)
```

## Debugging failures

- Check the first failing assertion; later failures may be cascading.
- Re-run with the same seed.
- If layout tests fail after intentional UI movement, update expected positions to the new layout.
- If seeded map/combat results change after an algorithm change, verify the new behavior against the intended rules before updating expected values.
- If a resource test fails, confirm `pdg.res.openResourceFile()` is opening `data/` and that all required IDs exist in `data/strings.txt`.

## CI notes

The suite is designed to exit 0 on success and 1 on failure. It requires the `gad4`/PDG runtime and the project `data/` directory, but it does not require network access.
